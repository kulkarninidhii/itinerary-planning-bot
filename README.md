# Itinerary Planning Bot

Planning a perfect trip takes hours where one has to research all about the places, the popular visit sights, the weather on those days etc. This process is extremely tiresome and takes long hours.

This bot helps user generate itinerary for the requirements provided. It takes input such as the Travel Dates, Budget, Destination, Number of People and the type of trip experience expected.

Based on these inputs, the bot generates a perfect itinerary for the users while including the recommendations based on the weather at that date.
